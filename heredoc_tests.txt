Here-doc Test Cases for read_heredoc_input

1. Basic single-line
   Input:
     command << DELIM
     hello
     DELIM
   Expectation: “hello\n” is sent to stdin of command.

2. Multi-line content                                           DONE
   Input:
     cat << EOF
     line1
     line2
     EOF
   Expectation: “line1\nline2\n”.

3. Empty here-doc                                               DONE
   Input:
     cmd << X
     X
   Expectation: An empty string (“”).

4. No matching delimiter (EOF)                                  DONE
   Input ends with Ctrl-D before delimiter.
   Expectation: Function returns NULL; shell handles gracefully.

5. Delimiter vs. similar string                                 DONE
   Input:
     sh << D
     D  
     D1
     D
   Expectation: Stops only on exact “D”; “D1” is treated as content.

6. Leading/trailing whitespace                                  DONE
   Input:
     echo << END
       indented
     END 
   Expectation: Only a line matching exactly “END” (no spaces) stops input.

7. Special characters in content                                DONE
   Input:
     cat << EOF
     $HOME and `pwd`
     EOF
   Expectation: Literal “$HOME and `pwd`” (no expansion).

8. Quoted delimiter (no stripping)                              DONE
   Input:
     cmd << "DELIM"
     foo
     DELIM
   Expectation: Only a line equal to “DELIM” ends input.

9. Interrupt signal (Ctrl-C)
   During prompt (“> ”), press Ctrl-C.
   Expectation: Signal handler invoked; function returns NULL.

10. Integration with pipes & redirects
    Input:
      grep foo << E | wc -l > out.txt
      foo
      bar
      E
    Expectation: Only “foo\n” is piped to wc -l; result written to out.txt.
